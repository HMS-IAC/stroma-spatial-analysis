# An Image Analysis Pipeline for Quantifying the Spatial Distribution of Fluorescently-Labeled Cell Markers in Stroma-Rich Tumors

![StromaCellMarkerQuant](images/fig1_workflow.png)

## Overview
This code repository provides the implementation of an image analysis pipeline for quantifying the spatial distribution of fluorescently-labeled cell markers in relation to the stromal border of solid tumor environments. The pipeline is designed to process high-resolution whole-slide images of fluorescently-labeled tissue sections and consists of: (1) a deep learning-based nuclei segmentation step using StarDist, (2) a machine learning-based composite classification step, and (3) a parameter sensitivity analysis and visualization step. The pipeline is implemented in QuPath (Groovy) and Python.


## Features
- Segmentation of nuclei in fluorescent images using pre-trained DL models
- Machine-learning based composite classification of cancer cells of interest
- Quantitative analysis of fluorescent markers across multiple images
- Spatial distribution using cell-stroma 2D signed distance
- Compatible with high-resolution whole-slide images 
- Visualization, sensitivity and statistical analysis of results in Python


## Software requirements
- Python 3.7 or higher (install required packages with `pip install -r requirements.txt`)
- QuPath 0.5 or higher
- StarDist extension for QuPath
- The pipeline was developed and tested on macOS Ventura 10.5. 


## Datasets
[![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/DOI/10.5281/zenodo.13122087.svg)](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.13122087)

Resulting cell measurements tables are free to download at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.13122087. 


## Reproducing results
To reproduce the spatial distribution plots found in the manuscript (Kozlova et al, 2024, Fig. 3), download the datasets (see above), run the notebooks cell-by-cell. Make sure to adapt the file paths to your local machine. 


## Install dependencies
To install the required Python packages in your environment, run the following commands in your terminal:

```bash
conda create -n stroma-spatial-analysis python=3.7
conda activate stroma-spatial-analysis
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

It should take only a few minutes to install all the required packages.


## Running the pipeline on your own data
To run the pipeline on your own data, follow the steps below:

1. Load your images into QuPath and create a project.
2. Run the scripts in the `qupath_scripts` folder in the following order:
    1. `stardist_cell_detection.groovy` (this step requires the StarDist extension for QuPath â€“ the installation tutorial can be found [here](https://qupath.readthedocs.io/en/0.4/docs/deep/stardist.html))
    2. `remove_impossible_nuclei.groovy`
    3. `cell_classification.groovy` if using threshold-based classification, otherwise follow [these instructions](https://qupath.readthedocs.io/en/stable/docs/tutorials/cell_classification.html#train-a-cell-classifier-based-on-annotations) from QuPath to train a machine learning classifier .
    4. `stroma_annotation.groovy` (make sure to adapt the thresholds to your images)
    5. `measurements_export.groovy` 
    
3. Run the Jupyter notebooks cell-by-cell in the `Python` folder to analyze the exported measurement tables.


## Distribution
Our image analysis pipeline is distributed as a collection of Groovy scripts for image processing in QuPath and Python Jupyter notebooks for statistical analysis and visualization.
